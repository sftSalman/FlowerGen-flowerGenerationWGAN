# Oxford Flower Dataset - WGAN Image Generation

This project focuses on using the Oxford Flower dataset to train a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for generating realistic flower images. The WGAN model learns the underlying patterns and distribution of flower images and generates new images that resemble the training data.

## Dataset

The Oxford Flower dataset consists of images of flowers categorized into 102 different classes. It provides a rich collection of flower images suitable for training the WGAN model. The dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/oxford-102-flower-pytorch/data).
